        <h4>Hang in there! We're still workin!</h4>
        <p> Sorry to let you down :( , I owe you a Favorites section!</p>
        <p>I started it out. To avoid the need of an auth process and user autorization for a session in order to use the favorites endpoint of the themoviedb API, I would use localStorage.</p>
        <p>I did some helpers (addFavorite, getFavorite etc).. but, by now, it will be better to finish this MVC on time.</p>
    </div>

export default Favorites;
