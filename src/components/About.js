        To know a person's favorite movies is to find a thread that We can follow to understand what touches they. So, browsing on YBMS you will know a little more about me and that's something you <strong>can't</strong> find on IMDB <span>;)</span>

        <p>
        My name is <span className="Body-primary font-weight-bolder">Joaquim Medeiros</span>, I was born in Curitiba, in the state of Paran√° (Brazil) at 1983. I started coding when I was a kid. I can't rebember why but, for a while, someone let this 8-bit MSX computer at our home. I was learning to read and had much fun copying the BASIC code instructions and seeing the results on the screen.

        <h3>Me as a frontend developer</h3>
      </div>
      <p>
      I'm a <strong>junior frontend developer</strong>. I first started developing for the frontend in middle 2018, using Angular to build a modern interface for a legacy system written in Delphi (which I also helped develop for some time).
      </p>
      <p>
      In 2019 I begin workin with ReactJS and still, step by step, learning and understanding this lib! So far so good.
      </p>
      <p>
      I used an old project of mine as boilerplate to build this, so there's a lot of architectural things to refactor now that I understand better the flux pattern! <span>:)</span>
