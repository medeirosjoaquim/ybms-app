## What is it

* Like the title says, this app let you browse through my favorite movies series ;)

## Why

* Because It's a way to know a little more about what I like (by knowing what movies and series I like) and to
see the way I solve some issues!

## Install

Here We do business with yarn! So, install packages with:

```yarn```

## Run

```yarn start```

## Access

I made an online version on heroku https://ybms-app.herokuapp.com/
(Sometimes the dyno is down cause it's a freeplan!)

## Test

```yarn test```

### You can get a test report with:

```yarn test -- --coverage```

(note extra -- in the middle)

## Issues

If there's something wrong you can open an issue in this repo!

## To do

Well, I did this in a hurry. And I've never really had the chance to study ReactJS before. So there's a lot of architectural issues I need to learn.
Also, I wish I had more time to implement well the tests and write better ones.

Also, It would be great to take snapshots from all components and insert
it in the heroku pipeline.
